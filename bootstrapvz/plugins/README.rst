Plugins are a key feature of bootstrap-vz. Despite their small size
(most plugins do not exceed 100 source lines of code) they can modify

Below you will find documentation for all plugins available for
bootstrap-vz. If you cannot find what you are looking for, consider
`developing it yourself <http://bootstrap-vz.readthedocs.org>`__ and
contribute to this list!
