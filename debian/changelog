bootstrap-vz (0.9.9-3) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Add 'bootstrap-vz-doc' package with Sphinx docs:
    - Add '0003-remove-taskoverview-from-html-documentation.patch' to prevent
    the resulting HTML pages from fetching external JS files, fixing litian's
    'privacy-breach-generic' complaint.
    - Register its documents with 'doc-base'.
    - Remove 'bootstrap-vz.3' man page generated generated from the same
    documentation source.
  * Add support for checking signed upstream tarballs:
    - Add Anders Ingemann (0D800D0D) and my (EF93257A) GPG keys to
    'debian/upstream/signing-key.asc'.
    - debian/watch: add 'pgpsigurlmangle' option.
    - Remove 'debian-watch-may-check-gpg-signature' lintian override.
  * debian/control:
    - Add 'bootstrap-vz-doc' as 'bootstrap-vz' suggested package.
    - Add 'parted' as suggested package, as sometimes 'kpartx' isn't enough and
    an error is raised asking for installing 'parted' as well.
    - Add 'python-sphinx' to Build-Depends.
    - Add 'wget' to 'Suggests', as it is used by some providers and plugins.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.7 (no changes).
    - Shorten short-description to fit in less than 60 chars, needed to append
    '(Docs)' to the description of 'bootstrap-vz-doc'.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Add copyright for Amazon and myself.
    - Bump years for Anders Ingemann and Marcin Kulisz.
    - Move license texts to the bottom of the file.
  * debian/rules:
    - Add 'override_dh_auto_build' to generate the HTML documentation during
    build time with Sphinx.
    - Add 'override_dh_compress' to prevent the HTML documentation from being
    compressed, which may change some filenames rendering its links broken.
    - Add 'override_dh_installchangelogs', as it was grabbing the wrong upstream
    changelog file. (Closes: #820607)
    - Extend 'override_dh_auto_clean' to remove unneeded files after
    generating the documentation.
  * Update Vcs URLs to the same on the Alioth web page.
  * wrap-and-sort the 'debian/' directory.
