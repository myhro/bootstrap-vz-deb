  [ Tiago Ilieve ]
  * Add a `.gitignore` file to the `debian/` directory, so the files generated
    during build doesn't get committed by accident
  * d/control: Update `Build-Depends`, add `dh-python` and remove the
    redundant `python` entry
  * d/control: added Tiago Ilieve <tiago.myhro@gmail.com> to the uploaders
  * d/control: Update `Depends`, remove `${shlibs:Depends}` to avoid a warning
    during build
  * d/rules: Override `dh_auto_clean` to remove the `*.egg-info` directory,
    which was preventing `debuild` from running more than one time
